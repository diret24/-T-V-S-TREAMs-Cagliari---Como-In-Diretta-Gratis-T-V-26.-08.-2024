Cagliari e Como sono alla ricerca della prima vittoria in campionato: la squadra di Nicola arriva dal pareggio casalingo contro la Roma mentre gli uomini di Fabregas hanno perso malamente contro la Juventus all'Allianz Stadium nella prima giornata.


Ad aprire il lunedì di Serie A sarà la sfida in programma alle 18.30 all'Unipol Domus tra Cagliari e Como. I sardi di Davide Nicola all'esordio, sempre tra le mura amiche, hanno fermato la Roma sullo 0-0 mentre i lombardi di Cesc Fabregas sono caduti 3-0 in casa della Juve (di Mbangula, Weah e Cambiaso le reti bianconere). Avvio di stagione opposto per le due formazioni: i rossoblù hanno infatti passato anche il primo turno di Coppa Italia superando 3-1 la Carrarese e ora affronteranno la Cremonese mentre i neopromossi, nonostante una campagna acquisti molto importante, hanno anche salutato immediatamente il trofeo nazionale perdendo ai calci di rigore al Ferraris contro la Sampdoria.
